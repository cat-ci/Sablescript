this is my first public website after a while of practicing 
This is a simple online IDE im working on using codemirror 

to change language or file name click the title on the top double click the name to change it or click the extention to change it 

repair fixes indentaion currently and in future will fix simple syntax errors
run currently only runs html files im working on getting other languages to run

the "UTF-8 | Windows (CR LF)" currently means nothing and doesent update

future updates:
tab linking will allow you to link content e.g "<img (src)="./image.png">" linking to another open tab<br>
extentions allow you to add custom functions, buttons, ui, languages<br>
settings will allow you to customise complete theming background, font, color etc<br>
ui overhall, icons, themes etc<br>
